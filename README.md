# ShowerController
Utilizes an Arduino uno and a stepper motor to control the temperature of the water in my shower.

Currently a work in progress.

Goals:
1) 3D print a case to house the arduino and motor safely from splashes of water.
2) Test the software and fine tune the variables to get the perfect adjustements.
3) Put everything together.
